# 💼 My Professional Portfolio (CV)

This repository is a personal portfolio site, showcasing my skills, projects, and experience as a software developer. It serves as an online CV where potential employers or collaborators can explore my work and learn more about me. The website is built with Gatsby and serves as a dynamic and responsive introduction to my professional journey.

## 🛠 Installation & Set Up

1. Install the Gatsby CLI

   ```sh
   npm install -g gatsby-cli
   ```

2. Install and use the correct version of Node using [NVM](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm)

   ```sh
   nvm install
   ```

3. Install dependencies

   ```sh
   yarn
   ```

4. Start the development server

   ```sh
   npm start
   ```
**NOTE:** If you encounter issues while running the application, try the following steps to clear the cache and restart your development server:
```sh
npx gatsby clean
```
This command removes the `.cache` folder. You’ll need to regenerate it before running:
```sh
npx gatsby develop
```

## 🚀 Building and Running for Production

1. Generate a full static production build

   ```sh
   npm run build
   ```

1. Preview the site as it will appear once deployed

   ```sh
   npm run serve
   ```
