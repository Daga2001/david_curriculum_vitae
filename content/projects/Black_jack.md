_Black Jack_ is a multiplayer card game where three players compete against a dealer. The game follows classic Black Jack rules, including betting, card drawing, and player turn rotation. The dealer plays last, and the round ends with players either winning, losing, or tying based on their hand value. The game supports restarting new rounds after each game ends.
