SmartBizGPT is my undergraduate thesis project for the Systems Engineering program, designed as a decision-support application for business management in the banking sector. It integrates databases, AI, and business intelligence, leveraging large language models (LLMs) to automate SQL queries via natural language. The project was awarded a meritorious mention for its innovative approach, particularly in applying LLMs to enhance enterprise solutions. [Watch the demo](https://youtu.be/OyNh1BEjneg).
