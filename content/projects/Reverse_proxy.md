It was designed to explore how a reverse proxy manages client requests, redirecting them to the appropriate servers that can process them. The server structure and design are not optimized for professional environments. This repository contains the files used to set up the server with tools like NGINX and Apache, with subfolders for each tool (e.g., nginx, apache) to help distinguish the files used in the implementation.
