This is my final project for Constraint Programming, where I tackled a simulated real-world problem. I applied various constraint programming techniques, including handling weak restrictions, optimizing multiple variables, and implementing several search algorithms to minimize the time required to find a solution that satisfies both CSP (Constraint Satisfaction Problem) and COP (Constraint Optimization Problem) requirements.
