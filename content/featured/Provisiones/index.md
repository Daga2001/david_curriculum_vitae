_Provisiones_ is a web application designed to facilitate the evaluation, scoring, and provisioning rules for credit portfolios in the housing, microcredit, and consumption (MRCO) and commercial (MRC) models, including a differentiated treatment for employee portfolios, as per the regulations outlined by the Superintendencia Financiera de Colombia in Chapter 2 of the Circular BÃ¡sica Contable y Financiera (Circular Externa 100 of 1995) and its annexes.

As a Security Analyst, I conducted a comprehensive penetration test (pentesting) for this application, covering all the phases of the pentesting process. I identified and fixed security vulnerabilities to ensure the application meets high security standards.
